# Guide to Ecosystem Mapping and Field Building

## The Case for Ecosystem Mapping  

### Situation

- You are encountering an **emerging field or ecosystem**—something distinct but not yet fully formed.  
- This might be an extension of an existing domain (e.g., cognitive science emerging from psychology) or a novel convergence of ideas and actors.  
- You want to **make sense of it**—understand who is involved, what ideas are circulating, and how the field is structured.  
- The goal could be research, investment, philanthropy, or field-building—helping the ecosystem mature and become self-aware.  
- You may also want to **shape its development**, influence its framing, or support key actors.  

### Complication

- **Lack of clarity**: The field lacks a shared identity, clear boundaries, or an established community.  
- **Information fragmentation**: No single institution, publication, or database captures the whole picture.  
- **Traditional methods fall short**: Academic journals, media coverage, and industry conferences often lag behind or fail to recognize emerging domains.  
- **Ecosystems are fluid**: Networks evolve rapidly, and influence is often informal or distributed.  
- **Mapping is complex**: Stakeholder relationships, conceptual frameworks, and key players are not always visible or structured.  

### Question

How do I quickly and effectively **understand, navigate, and engage** with an emerging field?  

### Hypothesis 

- **Ecosystem mapping** provides a structured way to:  
  - Identify key stakeholders, organizations, and thought leaders.  
  - Reveal patterns, relationships, and gaps in the field.  
  - Support decision-making for investment, funding, or strategic engagement.  
  - Help a field name itself, develop coherence, and gain recognition.  
  - Provide a foundation for field-building, movement-building, or industry development.  
- Effective mapping requires **specialized expertise**, balancing data collection with thoughtful structuring.  
- A strong map **creates clarity and impact**, helping actors within the field see themselves in relation to the whole and coordinate more effectively.
